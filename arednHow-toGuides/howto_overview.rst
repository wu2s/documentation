AREDN How-to Guides Overview
============================

As mentioned in the AREDN |trade| overview, the purpose of an amateur radio emergency data network is to provide typical Internet or intranet programs to people who need to communicate across a wide area during an emergency or community event. An AREDN |trade| network provides the transport mechanism for the types of programs people typically use today to communicate with each other in the normal course of their business and social interactions. 

A network must be planned, monitored and managed if it is to remain effective. 

The purpose for this section of the AREDN |trade| documentation is to share the collection of useful tips and techniques we use to plan, deploy, manage, monitor and enhance a mesh network.
